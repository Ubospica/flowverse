# Fixed-interrupt Flame Chase

`fixed_interrupt_flame_chase` brings the HMA paper's fixed-*k* alternation to the
current asynchronous Humanize flow API. Two agents take ordinary, fresh sessions
in one workspace. A trusted evaluator closes admission after *k* **accepted
experiments**. One final review by the other author can select an older accepted
candidate. The default is *k* = 5, six hours total, 900 seconds reserved for review,
and at most 600 seconds of reviewer execution.

It is `flame_chase` plus that interrupt, and the interrupt only needs something
that counts accepted experiments. Two admission backends provide it, chosen by
whether `gate_config` is given:

| | native MLE (`gate_config` set) | FlowBench (`gate_config` unset) |
|---|---|---|
| Counts | the native evaluator's receipts | records the cell's evaluator scored without `report.error` |
| Actor submits | `submit.py submit PATH.csv` | `submit.py submit` (builds with the workspace's `submit.sh`) |
| Admission service | `evaluator.py`, started by you | a loopback service inside the flow process |
| Candidate files | `<sha>.csv` in the native evaluator | `run_dir/candidates/<sha>` |
| Leftover `.fixed-interrupt/` | refused | replaced (a restarted FlowBench worker starts a new run) |

Every param has a default, so FlowBench, which passes no `-p`, can run it. The
wall clock is `active_time_limit_seconds` when set, else the run budget's
`duration` (FlowBench's `-c run.yaml`), else six hours; `run_dir` defaults to a
new directory under `~/.fixed_interrupt_flame_chase/`.

This is a native local flow integration. The paper's Docker runner additionally
creates a new container and HOME for every option and isolates private evaluator
files. `LocalEnv` does not provide those guarantees: native conversations are
fresh, but HOME, installed packages and the operating system are shared. Paths
outside the workspace are an organizational boundary, **not** protection from an
agent running as the same OS user. Use the HMA reproduction repository's isolated
runner for paper-equivalent containment and full benchmark reruns.

## Dependencies and task preparation

Use Python 3.12+ and current Humanize with the `AgentCollection`, `spawn`, and
async `run` API. The implementation is tested against Humanize commit
`56807697` (the local `/home/ubuntu/humanize` checkout). It does not support the
historical synchronous `Agent.new()` API or vendor a second Humanize runtime.
Install Humanize and the native CLIs for the two models you choose. For local
development, from this repository:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e /path/to/humanize pytest pytest-asyncio
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Prepare a **fresh** native MLE evaluator directory containing
`mle-evaluator-server.py`, `mle-score-worker.py`, and `mle-config.json`, alongside
prepared public/private task data and the pinned grader. The task configuration
must have `feedback_mode: "blind"` and `submission_limit: null`. Its dataset,
control and upstream paths must be reachable from the evaluator process. The HMA
repository's `hma-stage-evaluator --config ... --home /ABS/evaluator` can stage these generic
files from its evaluator configuration; it does not download task data by itself.
Dataset staging remains the benchmark integration's responsibility.

The included `evaluator.py` wraps this native evaluator without editing its code.
It requires the native `State` / `Handler`, receipt journal and retained artifact
interfaces used by the paper implementation. A generic scoreboard or a JSON file
of model-reported experiments is not a compatible replacement. Use a new native
ledger **and** a new turn journal for every task run.

## Start the trusted admission service

Keep evaluator/control directories outside the agent workspace. Create a random
local control key (this is a service capability, not a model API key):

```bash
mkdir -p /ABS/trusted
python3 -c 'import pathlib,secrets; p=pathlib.Path("/ABS/trusted/control.key"); p.write_text(secrets.token_urlsafe(32)); p.chmod(0o600)'
```

Run this command in a separate terminal using the benchmark's Python environment,
which must also have current Humanize installed:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/ABS/flowverse/flows python -m fixed_interrupt_flame_chase.evaluator \
  --base /ABS/evaluator/workspace/.flowbench/mle-evaluator-server.py \
  --control /ABS/trusted/turns.json \
  --key-file /ABS/trusted/control.key \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Copy `gate.example.json` outside the workspace and fill its absolute file paths.
The endpoint is a local evaluator URL; it is unrelated to a model provider's API
base URL. Provider API keys and base URLs in `providers.env.example` are empty.
Configure the native CLIs yourself; the flow does not read that template, copy
credentials or configure providers automatically. No credentials are stored in
its contract, results or prompt.

## Run

Start from the task's shared workspace, containing the public input and task
instructions. Use a new `run_dir` outside it:

```bash
hmz exec -f /ABS/flowverse/flows/fixed_interrupt_flame_chase \
  -a first_chaser=claude/claude-opus-5:max \
  -a second_chaser=codex/gpt-5.6-sol:max \
  -b duration=6h \
  -p gate_config=/ABS/trusted/gate.json \
  -p run_dir=/ABS/results/new-task-run \
  -p max_valid_submissions_per_session=5 \
  -p active_time_limit_seconds=21600 \
  -p review_reserve_seconds=900 \
  -p review_turn_seconds=600 \
  "$(cat TASK.md)"
```

Model availability and effort values belong to the installed native CLI. The
names above illustrate the paper pair; this flow does not pin provider model
versions. The flow's own wall clock includes review. Humanize also requires a
framework budget; the example supplies `-b duration=6h`. A tighter `hmz -b`
budget can end it earlier, including before review; do not set a six-hour
*active-agent* budget expecting it to replace this wall-clock deadline.

The prompt directs actors to `python3 .fixed-interrupt/submit.py submit PATH.csv`.
`validate PATH.csv` validates without consuming an experiment; `status` exposes
only accepted count, closed and exhausted. Existing task prompts that explicitly
point to a different submit helper must be updated to this helper. The helper
does not install itself over existing task scripts.

The flow refuses an existing output directory, existing `.fixed-interrupt`
workspace directory, or nonempty evaluator ledger. It is intentionally **not
resumable**. After a failed run, retain its evidence and start a new task run with
fresh evaluator/control state; never restart an old budget or run alongside an
old agent process.

## Protocol

- The evaluator, under its native score lock, enforces accepted count, turn token
  and deadline. Concurrent submissions cannot overshoot *k*. Invalid predictions,
  validations and artifact duplicates do not increment the native receipt count.
  The polling loop determines when to cancel the session; it is not the cap gate.
- Each turn is a hidden subflow with one fresh session, no `/goal` continuation,
  no transcript transfer and no additional planning agent. Completed subflow
  cleanup is awaited before another agent starts. Workspace files carry over.
- Options end at natural return, the accepted cap, or the exploration deadline.
  Natural return wins when it is already observed at the cap boundary, matching
  Appendix A's tie convention. The historical Docker polling implementation checked
  exhaustion first; option-closure labels from that runner can differ at ties.
- The cap is absent from the task prompt and actor-facing status. Public source
  and a shared-user environment mean it is not secret from deliberate inspection.
- All submitting turns share `start + total - reserve`. A score that finishes
  after that deadline is rejected before its accepted receipt is committed.
- Final review runs only with at least two accepted candidates. It is assigned to
  the agent opposite the author of the latest accepted candidate, even if later
  options accepted zero experiments. The ballot has identities, order and
  `you`/`peer` authorship, with no scores or medal verdicts. Candidate bytes are
  verified against native artifact hashes before copying.
- Review admission is zero. The reviewer can nominate only an existing candidate
  and gets its actual remaining wall explicitly. Silence, malformed/unknown
  nominations and reviewer errors retain the standing candidate. There is one
  ballot and no retry. Finalization reuses accepted bytes and stays within the
  global deadline; a recognizably committed receipt is reconciled after an error.
- The default reserve includes 35 seconds for cleanup and 60 for finalization.
  Session cancellation is given five seconds before reporting a cleanup failure;
  no successor is dispatched on that failure. Humanize/CLI shutdown and OS child
  processes still depend on the backend. A malfunctioning local backend can
  outlive Python cancellation; the evaluator continues rejecting expired submits.
  A local flow cannot promise Docker-style process teardown or a hard OS kill.
- Provider or evaluator failure during exploration propagates and marks the run
  failed. The protocol does not turn authentication errors into natural handoffs.

The final selected identity refers to the nominated original receipt when review
changes selection; native finalization may append a new receipt with the same
artifact hash. An evaluator transport failure during finalization can leave its
completion uncertain until the service settles; that case returns `status: incomplete` and
`review_finalization_unconfirmed`, retaining the pre-review candidate as the fallback.
Retain the failed-call evidence
and inspect the authoritative ledger before treating such a run as a benchmark
result.

## FlowBench tasks

Run it as any other FlowBench flow: no evaluator to start and no params. Each
`submit.py submit` runs `bash submit.sh <tmp>` in the workspace, uploads what it
wrote to `evaluator_url` (`http://evaluator`) exactly as the worker's own autoeval
does, and answers with the evaluator's record. A build that fails, a record with
an `error` in its report (aopt's penalty, kd's parity, ...), a duplicate of an
accepted build, and a score that lands after its turn closed are not
experiments. `submit.py validate` only builds. Final review re-uploads the
nominated candidate so it is the cell's last record.

The task's autoeval keeps running beside the flow and is not counted. The two
run `submit.sh` in one workspace unordered, so a task's `submit.sh` must not write
into the workspace it builds from (humanfia/flowbench-internal#58 makes aopt and
swe_vllm_kv_cache_watermark hold to that).
Feedback is whatever the task gives: the flow does not hide the evaluator's
record, and aopt's own brief points actors at `/scores`.

## Outputs and checks

`run_dir` contains `contract.json` (parameters and original deadline), `turns.json`
(option authors, closure reasons and accepted counts), `review.json`, and
`result.json`. Humanize retains its own session transcripts. The shared
`.fixed-interrupt/review/` contains only the blind ballot and candidate copies;
the current token route is removed at shutdown. The native evaluator retains the
authoritative receipts and candidate hashes.

From the flowverse checkout, with Humanize and pytest installed:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_fixed_interrupt_flame_chase.py tests/test_fixed_interrupt_flowbench.py tests/test_simple_flows.py -q
```

These tests need no provider credentials, network services, Docker or GPU. They
exercise the real native flow engine with fake agents, plus the actual admission
wrapper with concurrent synthetic submissions, and the FlowBench backend over
real HTTP against a fake FlowBench evaluator. Live CLIs, paid model calls,
real benchmark grading and container isolation are not verified by these tests.

The admission wrapper derives from
`antoinegg1/flowverse/flows/flame_chase_submit3_minimal/evaluator.py` at `e4c8033`.
The native scheduler, adapter and tests were added here; the historical Docker
supervisor and artifacts-only workspace exporter were not copied.
